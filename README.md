#### **WARNING**
- Given the dynamic nature of Microsoft Azure cloud tools, you might experience Azure UI changes after the development of this training content. These changes might cause the lab instructions and lab steps to not match up.

- Microsoft updates this training course when the community brings needed changes to our attention; however, because cloud updates occur frequently, you might encounter UI changes before this training content updates. If this occurs, **adapt to the changes, and then work through them in the labs as needed**.
